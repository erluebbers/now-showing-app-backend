The Now Shoping App is a tool to look up movies by theater and vice versa that demonstrates the functionality of a Sinatra Backend and React Frontend application. Within this app, there are a few features:

- You can look at movies by exploring 4 ficitional Seattle movie theaters and use a select dropdwon to see the movies that are playing at each of those theaters. 
- If you already know what movie that you want to see, you can do to a different dropdown and select the movie and it will automatically display which theaters it is playing at. 
- In addition to that, let's say you go to a movie and it turns out that the audio or picture is not working correctly. You can report that a screen is broken and the number of screens showing movies at each theater will update. 
- This has been a tough time for Movie Theaters and they are closing all the time. To ensure our app users are able to get the most up-to-date information about a theater closure, you can report a theater closure and the location of the theater will be updated to be "CLOSED".

This app leverages the functionality that come from a many-to-many rleationship within the Sinatra backend as well as CRUD actions that allow the React Frontend and Sinatra backend to interact in intuitive ways.
